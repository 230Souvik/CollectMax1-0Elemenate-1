Collect maximum points in a matrix by satisfying given constraints
Google Translate Icon
Given an M Ã— N matrix where each cell can have a value of 1, 0, or -1, where -1 denotes an unsafe cell, collect the maximum number of ones starting from the first cell and by visiting only safe cells (i.e., 0 or 1). We can only go left or down if the row is odd; otherwise, we can only go right or down from the current cell.![image](https://github.com/230Souvik/CollectMax1-0Elemenate-1/assets/135532224/9b0d9d28-113f-49ec-9bfb-901c1d2186d6)
